# Portfolio Site

Hi! Thank you for checking out this repo.
I orignally built this site to showcase my work, as well as stretch my new skills in vue. I've now retired my previous project and decided to dockerfy my workflow as well as make some changes to the scope of the blog platform.

The previous project changed scope and became too feature packed for its own good.
So I've started a new project which will work better as an online CV.

This is a MEVN Stack single page application which should hopefully showcase my previous work, while being a great showcase of my skill in itself!

## Here are some key skills which will be used in this site:

- VueJS
- VueRouter
- VueX
- Normalised database structure for minimised database duplication
- Inline SVGs for more flexibility and scalability
- No-Library CSS Animations and layouts
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- BEM CSS Class notation
- Axios for Node backend calls
- MondoDb Database
- Node JS backend
- Express bespoke blog system
- Token based Authentication

## Other Notable Features

- Image upload
- Single page application
- Filter projects by skills
- Markdown Blog post creation (I didn't even know that JAM Stack was a thing when I decided to use this üôÉ )

## [Planned features]

- Hosting on ???
- Responsive Design

## [Icebox (no time soon) features]

- Feedback system
- GraphQl
- Canonical Links

## Known Bugs (Non priority)

- None so far!

## [Changed features]
